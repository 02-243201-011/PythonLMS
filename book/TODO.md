Python for Everybody TODO List
------------------------------

Welcome to the under-construction book "Python 3.0 for Everybody".

Feel free to add things to this TODO list and/or file GitHub
Issues to track activity.

Tasks to do:

* Go through and fix all the code sequences - fix any Python 2.0 and then 
run the code to verify the output

* Double check the output of the interactive sequences

* Redraw all figures in OmniGraffle

* Fix all the sample code in the code3 folder

* Fix the Appendices (now rendering as chapters)

* Make a new awesome cover

And many other things...
