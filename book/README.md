This is a very rought conversion.  I write several Python programs
(see the convert folder) to go theough the LaTeX, hack it, extract 
anything that looked like code, run it through 2to3 and put in the 
converted code.  So some miraculously is perfectly converted but 
other bits are still broken or Python 2.0 because my auto-process
missed something.   We will fix those by hand.

Tasks to do:

* Go through and fix all the code sequences - fix any Python 2.0 and then 
run the code to verify the output

* Find, fix and remove all the Python 3.0 does this differend footnotes

* Make a new cover

* Redraw all figures in OmniGraffle

And many other things...
