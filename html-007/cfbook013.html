<H1><FONT COLOR=black><A NAME="htoc146">Chapter&nbsp;12</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Networked programs</FONT></H1>
<FONT COLOR=black>While many of the examples in this book have focused on reading
files and looking for data in those files, there are many different
sources of information when one considers the Internet.<BR>
<BR>
In this chapter we will pretend to be a web browser and retrieve web
pages using the HyperText Transport Protocol (HTTP). Then we will read
through the web page data and parse it.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc134"></A>
<H2><FONT COLOR=black><A NAME="htoc147">12.1</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;HyperText Transport Protocol - HTTP</FONT></H2>
<FONT COLOR=black>The network protocol that powers the web is actually quite simple and 
there is built-in support in Python called <TT>sockets</TT> which makes it very 
easy to make network connections and retrieve data over those
sockets in a Python program.<BR>
<BR>
A <B>socket</B> is much like a file, except that it 
provides a two-way connection between two 
programs with a single socket. 
You can both read from and write to the same socket. If you write something to 
a socket it is sent to the application at the other end of the socket. If you 
read from the socket, you are given the data which the other application has sent.<BR>
<BR>
But if you try to read a socket when the program on the other end of the socket
has not sent any data - you just sit and wait. If the programs on both ends
of the socket simply wait for some data without sending anything, they will wait for
a very long time.<BR>
<BR>
So an important part of programs that communicate over the Internet is to have some
sort of protocol. A protocol is a set of precise rules that determine who
is to go first, what they are to do, and then what are the responses to that message,
and who sends next and so on. In a sense the two applications at either end 
of the socket are doing a dance and making sure not to step on each other's toes.<BR>
<BR>
There are many documents which describe these network protocols. The HyperText Transport 
Protocol is described in the following document:<BR>
<BR>
<TT>http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.txt</TT><BR>
<BR>
This is a long and complex 176 page document with a lot of detail. If you 
find it interesting feel free to read it all. But if you take a look around page 36 of
RFC2616 you will find the syntax for the GET request. If you read in detail, you will
find that to request a document from a web server, we make a connection to 
the <TT>www.py4inf.com</TT> server on port 80, and then send a line of the form:<BR>
<BR>
<TT>GET http://www.py4inf.com/code/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0 </TT><BR>
<BR>
Where the second parameter is the web page we are requesting and then 
we also send a blank line. The web server will respond with some 
header information about the document and a blank line
followed by the document content.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc135"></A>
<H2><FONT COLOR=black><A NAME="htoc148">12.2</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;The World's Simplest Web Browser</FONT></H2>
<FONT COLOR=black>Perhaps the easiest way to show how the HTTP protocol works is to write a very 
simple Python program that makes a connection to a web server and following
the rules of the HTTP protocol, requests a document 
and displays what the server sends back.
</FONT><PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
import socket

mysock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)
mysock.connect(('www.py4inf.com', 80))
mysock.send('GET http://www.py4inf.com/code/romeo.txt HTTP/1.0\n\n')

while True:
    data = mysock.recv(512)
    if ( len(data) &lt; 1 ) :
        break
    print data

mysock.close()
</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>First the program makes a connection to port 80 on 
the server <TT>www.py4inf.com</TT>.
Since our program is playing the role of the ``web browser'' the HTTP
protocol says we must send the GET command followed by a blank line.<BR>
</FONT><DIV ALIGN=center><FONT COLOR=black><IMG SRC="cfbook013.png"></FONT></DIV><FONT COLOR=black>
<BR>
Once we send that blank line, we write a loop that receives data 
in 512 character chunks from the socket and prints the data out 
until there is no more data to read (i.e. the recv() returns 
an empty string).<BR>
<BR>
The program produces the following output:
</FONT><PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Sun, 14 Mar 2010 23:52:41 GMT

But soft what light through yonder window breaks
It is the east and Juliet is the sun
Arise fair sun and kill the envious moon

</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>The output starts with headers which the web server sends
to describe the document.
For example, the <TT>Content-Type </TT> header indicated that
the document is a plain text document (<TT>text/plain</TT>).<BR>
<BR>
After the server sends us the headers, it adds a blank line
to indicate the end of the headers and then sends the actual
data of the file <TT>romeo.txt</TT>.<BR>
<BR>
This example shows how to make a low-level network connection
with sockets. Sockets can be used to communicate with a web
server or with a mail server or many other kinds of servers.
All that is needed is to find the document which describes
the protocol and write the code to send and receive the data
according to the protocol.<BR>
<BR>
However, since the protocol that we use most commonly is
the HTTP (i.e. the web) protocol, Python has a special 
library specifically designed to support the HTTP protocol 
for the retrieval of
documents and data over the web.</FONT><BR>

<H2><FONT COLOR=black><A NAME="htoc149">12.3</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Retrieving web pages with <TT>urllib</TT></FONT></H2>
<FONT COLOR=black>The <TT>urllib</TT> library makes it very easy to retrieve
web pages and process the data in Python. Using <TT>urllib</TT>
you can treat a web page much like a file. You simply
indicate which web page you would like to retrieve and
<TT>urllib</TT> handles all of the HTTP protocol details.<BR>
<BR>
The equivalent code to read the <TT>romeo.txt</TT> file
from the web using <TT>urllib</TT> is as follows:
</FONT><PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
import urllib

fhand = urllib.urlopen('http://www.py4inf.com/code/romeo.txt')
for line in fhand:
   print line.strip()
</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>Once the web page has been opened with 
<TT>urllib.urlopen</TT> we can treat it like 
a file and read through it using a 
<TT>for</TT> loop. <BR>
<BR>
When the program runs, we only see the output
of the contents of the file. The headers
are still sent, but the <TT>urllib</TT> code
consumes the headers and only returns the 
data to us.
</FONT><PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
But soft what light through yonder window breaks

</FONT></PRE>
<FONT COLOR=black>As an example, we can write

<TT>romeo.txt</TT> and compute the frequency
of each word in the file as follows:
</FONT><PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
import urllib

counts = dict()
fhand = urllib.urlopen('http://www.py4inf.com/code/romeo.txt')
for line in fhand:
    words = line.split()
    for word in words:
        counts[word] = counts.get(word,0) + 1   
print counts

<A NAME="@default736"></A>
<A NAME="@default737"></A>
<FONT COLOR=black>One of the common uses of the <TT>urllib</TT> capability in Python is 
to <B>scrape</B> the web. Web scraping is when we write a program
that pretends to be a web browser and retrieves pages and then 
examines the data in those pages looking for patterns.<BR>
<BR>
As an example, a search engine such as Google will look at the source 
of one web page and extract the links to other pages and retrieve
those pages, extracting links, and so on. Using this technique,
Google <B>spiders</B> its way through nearly all of the pages on 
the web. <BR>
<BR>
Google also uses the frequency of links from pages it finds 
to a particular page as one measure of how ``important'' 
a page is and how highly the page should appear in its search results.</FONT><BR>

<H2><FONT COLOR=black><A NAME="htoc151">12.5</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Parsing HTML using Regular Expressions</FONT></H2>
<FONT COLOR=black>One simple way to parse HTML is to use regular expressions to repeatedly
search and extract for substrings that match a particular pattern.<BR>
<BR>
Here is a simple web page:
</FONT><PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
&lt;h1&gt;The First Page&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
If you like, you can switch to the
&lt;a href="http://www.dr-chuck.com/page2.htm"&gt;
Second Page&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;
</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>We can construct a well-formed regular expression to match
and extract the link values from the above text as follows:
</FONT><PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
href="http://.+?"
</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>Our regular expression looks for strings that start with
``href="http://'' followed by one or more characters
``.+?'' followed by another double quote. The question mark 
added to the ``.+?'' indicates that the match is to be done
in a ``non-greedy'' fashion instead of a ``greedy'' fashion. 
A non-greedy match tries to find the <EM>smallest</EM> possible matching
string and a greedy match tries to find the <EM>largest</EM> possible
matching string.
<A NAME="@default738"></A>
<A NAME="@default739"></A><BR>
<BR>
We need to add parentheses to our regular expression to indicate
which part of our matched string we would like to extract and
produce the following program:
</FONT><A NAME="@default740"></A>
<A NAME="@default741"></A>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
import urllib
import re

url = raw_input('Enter - ')
html = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
links = re.findall('href="(http://.*?)"', html)
for link in links:
    print link
</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>The <TT>findall</TT> regular expression method will give us a list of all
of the strings that match our regular expression, returning only
the link text between the double quotes.<BR>
<BR>
When we run the program, we get the following output:

</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>Regular expressions work very nice when your HTML is well-formatted
and predictable. But since there is a lot of ``broken'' HTML pages
out there, you might find that a solution only using 
regular expressions might either miss some valid links or end up 
with bad data.<BR>
<BR>
This can be solved by using a robust HTML parsing library.</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="toc139"></A>
<H2><FONT COLOR=black><A NAME="htoc152">12.6</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Parsing HTML using BeautifulSoup</FONT></H2>
<A NAME="@default742"></A>
<FONT COLOR=black>There are a number of Python libraries which can help you parse
HTML and extract data from the pages. Each of the libraries
has its strengths and weaknesses and you can pick one based on 
your needs.<BR>
<BR>
As an example, we will simply parse some HTML input 
and extract links using the <B>BeautifulSoup</B> library. 
You can download and install the BeautifulSoup code
from:<BR>
<BR>
<TT>www.crummy.com</TT><BR>
<BR>
You can download and ``install'' BeautifulSoup or you 
can simply place the <TT>BeautifulSoup.py</TT> file in the
same folder as your application.<BR>
<BR>
Even though HTML looks like XML and some pages are carefully 
constructed to be XML, most HTML is generally broken in ways
that cause an XML parser to reject the entire page of HTML as
improperly formed. BeautifulSoup tolerates highly flawed 
HTML and still lets you easily extract the data you need.<BR>
<BR>
We will use <TT>urllib</TT> to read the page and then use
<TT>BeautifulSoup</TT> to extract the <TT>href</TT> attributes from the
anchor (<TT>a</TT>) tags.
</FONT><A NAME="@default743"></A>

<PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
import urllib
from BeautifulSoup import *

html = urllib.urlopen(url).read()
soup = BeautifulSoup(html)

# Retrieve all of the anchor tags
tags = soup('a')
for tag in tags:
   print tag.get('href', None)
</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>The program prompts for a web address, then opens the web
page, reads the data and passes the data to the BeautifulSoup
parser, and then retrieves all of the anchor tags and prints
out the <TT>href</TT> attribute for each tag.<BR>
<BR>
When the program runs it looks as follows:

   # Look at the parts of a tag
   print 'TAG:',tag
   print 'URL:',tag.get('href', None)
   print 'Content:',tag.contents[0]

<H2><FONT COLOR=black><A NAME="htoc153">12.7</A>&nbsp;&nbsp;Reading binary files using urllib</FONT></H2>
<FONT COLOR=black>Sometimes you want to retrieve a non-text (or binary) file such as
an image or video file. The data in these files is generally not 
useful to print out but you can easily make a copy of a URL to a local
file on your hard disk using <TT>urllib</TT>.
<A NAME="@default746"></A><BR>
<BR>
The pattern is to open the URL and use <TT>read</TT> to download the entire
contents of the document into a string variable (<TT>img</TT>) and then write that
information to a local file as follows:
</FONT><PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
img = urllib.urlopen('http://www.py4inf.com/cover.jpg').read()
fhand = open('cover.jpg', 'w')
fhand.write(img)
fhand.close()
</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>This program reads all of the data in at once across the network and 
stores it in the variable <TT>img</TT> in the main memory of your computer
and then opens the file <TT>cover.jpg</TT> and writes the data out to your 
disk. This will work if the size of the file is less than the size
of the memory of your computer.<BR>
<BR>
However if this is a large audio or video file, this program may crash
or at least run extremely slowly when your computer runs out of memory.
In order to avoid running out of memory, we retrieve the data in blocks
(or buffers) and then write each block to your disk before retrieving
the next block. This way the program can read any sized file without
using up all of the memory you have in your computer.
</FONT><PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
import urllib

img = urllib.urlopen('http://www.py4inf.com/cover.jpg')
fhand = open('cover.jpg', 'w')
size = 0
while True:
    info = img.read(100000)
    if len(info) &lt; 1 : break
    size = size + len(info)
    fhand.write(info)

print size,'characters copied.'
fhand.close()
</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>In this example, we read only 100,000 characters at a time and then 
write those characters to the <TT>cover.jpg</TT> file
before retrieving the next 100,000 characters of data from the
web.<BR>
<BR>
This program runs as follows:
</FONT><PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
python curl2.py 
568248 characters copied.
</FONT></PRE>
<FONT COLOR=black>If you have a Unix or Macintosh computer, you probably have a command
built into your operating system that performs this operation
as follows:
</FONT><A NAME="@default747"></A>
<PRE><FONT SIZE=4 COLOR=blue>
curl -O http://www.py4inf.com/cover.jpg
</FONT></PRE><FONT COLOR=black>The command <TT>curl</TT> is short for ``copy URL'' and so these two 
examples are cleverly named <TT>curl1.py</TT> and <TT>curl2.py</TT> on 
<TT>www.py4inf.com/code</TT> as they implement similar functionality
to the <TT>curl</TT> command. There is also a <TT>curl3.py</TT> sample 
program that does this task a little more effectively in case you
actually want to use this pattern in a program you are writing.</FONT><BR>
