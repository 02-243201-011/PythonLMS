This gives the most up-to-date recommendations for using SQLite3 browser.
For Macintosh look for files that end in "dmg" for Windows look for files that end
in "zip".
</p>
<ul>
<li>The best option is to use the latest version
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/" target="_new">
Version 2.0 Beta1</a>.  But this version sometimes hangs in the "Execute
SQL" window.
<li>If you have a problem with the latest version, try
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitebrowser/files/sqlitebrowser/1.3/" target="_new">
Version 1.3</a>.  For some Mac operating systems you may need to install "Rosetta" 
to run verison 1.3.  This is OK.
If the above links do not work, I have a local copy for
<a href="sqlitebrowser-1.3-osx.dmg" target="_new">Macintosh Version 1.3</a> and
<a href="sqlitebrowser-1.3-win.zip" target="_new">Windows Version 1.3</a>.
<li>
On some Windows system, you may get a "Missing DLL" message - if so download
<a href="msvcr71.zip">msvcr71.zip</a>, unzip it and install the DLL file 
in "C:\Windows\System32\".
</ul>
<p>
It would be nice if everything just worked, by ah-well.
