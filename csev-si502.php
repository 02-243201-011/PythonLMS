<p><h1>Welcome to PythonLearn.com</h1></p>
<p>
Welcome SI502 students.  If you are in the middle
of a semster and Dr. Chuck is teaching SI502, this site will be being 
updated as the semester progresses.   While the site will be complete,
later material will be from earlier semesters and earlier material will
be from the current semester.
</p>
<p>
<a href="index.php" target="_new">Continue to the www.pythonlearn.com materials.</a>
<p>
You can look ahead at the materials and screencasts to study for 
upcoming weeks - but expect a bit of tweaking and cleanup 
right before each in-class lecture during the semester.
