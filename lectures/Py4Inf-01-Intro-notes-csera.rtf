\f0\fs24 \cf0 I just finished watching the video.  There's a very logical breaking point at about 21:36 (right after the hard disk video link) you start quite a different section, "Python as a Language".  A second good break point would probably be about 37:22, where the heading says, "Program Steps or Program Flow".  Three segments would probably be very good.}
