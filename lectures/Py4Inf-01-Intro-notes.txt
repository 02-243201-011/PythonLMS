I've been through the Introduction video and only see three places where you really need to pause and add external video links: 7:20 for Macarena, 20:50 for the CPU, and 21:25 for the hard disk. I suggest saying that these are optional, and students who cannot access YouTube need not be concerned. Maybe another place to pause should be at 36:50, clarifying that the Python installation is not a prerequisite, though it is is highly recommended.

Installing and running Python on your laptop or desktop is optional. All of the assignments can be done using the browser only - even on a tablet or phone. But you will learn more about how to program if you can develop these programs on your laptop or desktop.

I like showing you examples on a computer (i.e. not on a PDA) to show you how to program outside of the browser even if you decide not to use a desktop or laptop in this class.
